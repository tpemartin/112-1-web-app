## 3.1 What is NodeJS?

NodeJS could be consider as a general purpose language. It is not only for web development. It is also used for desktop application development, mobile application development, and IoT (Internet of Things) development. In this course, we will focus on its frontend web development capability. 

There are several frontend frameworks built on top of NodeJS. We will use ReactJS in this course. (VueJS and AngularJS are also popular frontend frameworks built on top of NodeJS.).

Most languages comes with their own package manager. For example, R comes with `install.packages()`. Python comes with `pip`. NodeJS comes with `npm` (Node Package Manager). Later we will use `npm` to install various packages/libraries for our frontend development.
