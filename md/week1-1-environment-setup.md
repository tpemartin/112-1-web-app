# 1. Environment setup


A developer environment involves with the following setups:

  * Programming language,  
  * Integrated Development Environment (IDE),  
  * Version control system

Before you started, there is one thing to avoid when you install the software:

  * Do not install the software in a directory that contains spaces or special characters. (不要有中文，空白，或特殊符號在儲存資料匣的路徑)  
  * Do not install the software to a network or shared drive. (不要存在One Drive, Google Drive, Dropbox, 等等)  
  * Do not install the software in a directory that requires elevated privileges (e.g. `C:\Program Files` in Windows). (不要存在需要管理員權限的資料匣)  

> To find out the absolute path of a folder in Windows, right-click the folder and select "Properties". The absolute path is shown in the "Location" field. See the following screenshot for an example.

## 1.1 Programming language

For the course we will use [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). It is a free and open-source programming language. It is available for Windows, Mac and Linux.

## 1.2 Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. For R language, we will use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It is a free and open-source IDE developed by Microsoft. It is available for Windows, Mac and Linux.

### Install Visual Studio Code

1. Download the latest version of RStudio Desktop from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

## 1.3 Version control system (VCS)

### a. What is version control system?  
A version control system (VCS) is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows you to revert files or a project to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.

> 一旦設定好某個資料匣受版本控制追踪，這資料匣裡的任何內容更動都會有記錄，也有備份。每個記錄可想成是一個版本，後續若要回復到某個特定的版本，或是比較不同版本的差異，都可以透過版本控制系統來達成。

### b. Github.com

[GitHub.com](https://github.com) is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. It is a free and open-source version control system. It is available for Windows, Mac and Linux.

We will install VCS through installing [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). It is a free and open-source VCS developed by GitHub. It is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. To use GitHub Desktop, you need to create a GitHub account first.

### Create a GitHub account  

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com).  
2. Click "Sign up".  
3. Enter your username, email address, and password.  
4. Click "Create account".  
5. Click "Verify email address".  
6. Go to your email inbox and click the link in the email from GitHub.  
   
### Install GitHub Desktop

1. Download the latest version of GitHub Desktop from [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/).  
2. Run the installer.  
3. Click "Next".  
4. Click "Install".  
5. Click "Finish".  
6. Click "Sign in to GitHub.com".  
7. Enter your GitHub username and password.  
8. Click "Sign in".  
9. Click "Continue".
